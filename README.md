## Overview of the Analysis
***
Citibike runs a bikesharing service in New York City. They are looking to expand the services in other cities around the country and found an angel investor in Des Moines, IA.
The bikesharing project is to analyze New York City CITI Bike data from August 2019 and then create a proposal on how it may work in Des Moines, IA.

## Results
***
Below you can view various visualizations detailing the how CITI Bikes are used in NYC. From these data, investors can determine how best to market and implement a CITI bikes program in Des Moines.

### Top Starting and Ending Locations
The graphs below show the top starting and ending locations for CITI Bikes. As you may suspect, the graphs look very similar with the majority of bikes being used towards the center of NYC.

### Bike Use by Gender
In August 2019, CITI bikes were predominantly used by men.

### Check Out Times
Check out times peaked between the hours of 5AM and 6AM, this can likely be attributed to folks commuting to work at that time.

### Check Out Times by Gender
This graph is similar to the one above, but breaks down checkout times by gender. As we learned from the "Bike Use by Gender" graph, in August 2019, more men used CITI bikes than women (or "unknown" genders), the below graph confirms that and shows the higher number of bikes that men check out througout the day.

### User Trips by Weekday per Hour
These heatmaps show the time of day that trips are taken. Most CITI bikes are used in the evenings around 5PM-6PM with greatest use on Thursday evenings.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
The below heatmaps show the frequency of user trips by gender by weekday, broken up by user type. We can see that subscribers have a lot more frequent use than customers.

### User Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Finally, this map shows frequency of CITI bike use by time of day by gender. With this heatmap we can see that the use pattern is roughly similar between men and women (though, again, this dataset shows men using CITI bikes more frequently). There is not discernable use pattern for "unknown" genders.

## Summary
The above visualizations show frequency and weekday patterns of use by gender, and subscriber type, as well as where bikes are most frequently used. As stated above, men use CITI bikes more frequently, though it could be interesting to look at winter patterns in other months/seasons throughout the year and see if those differences in gender change at all. Based on these data it could benefit CITI bikes to push a marketing campaign targeted at women. It also seems that implementing a subscriber model in Des Moines would be a benefit as that shows the most use in the New York setting.

Further visualizations that could benefit this analysis would be a graph showing use by time of day charted on a geographic map to show where people are coming and going from. I would also like to look at the CITI bike use outside of downtown NYC. As Des Moines is a much small and more dispersed city, it would be helpful to look at CITI bike use patterns in more geographically dispersed areas.
